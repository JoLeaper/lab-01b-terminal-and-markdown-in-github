# I am here to demonstrate my MARKDOWN SKILLZ.
### <i> I haven't used Markdown in a MINUTE, so bare with me. </i>

## I previously used Markdown in the following courses:
1. **INFO 200.**
2. **INFO 201.**

## Speaking of coding classes, here are the coding classes I have taken in school and the languages I learned!
* **CSE 121 : C**
* **CSE 142 : Java**
* **INFO 201 : R**
* **INFO 343 : SQL**

## Here's how hard they were!

| CSE 121        | CSE 142   | INFO 201     |  INFO 343       
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |  :------------- |
|  Moderately | EXTREMELY   | Decently    |   Challenging | 



### Here is some random code I wrote for practice.
```js
const x = 1;
for (let i = 0; i > 6; i++) {
    console.log(i - x);
}
```
